## 🧵 THREAD: Full Story (3 tweets)

### Tweet 1:
```
🚀 We just launched OpenGrant.

The problem: 95% of open source projects never get funded. Not because they're not fundable. Because they don't know where to look.

The solution: AI that finds funding opportunities for you.

#OpenSource #Funding

### Tweet 2:
```
Here's what OpenGrant does:

✅ Analyzes your GitHub repo (code, activity, community, impact)
✅ Matches you to 298+ verified funding sources (grants, sponsors, VCs, foundations)
✅ Generates custom grant applications ready to submit
✅ Tracks your "fundability score" and predicts trends

All in seconds.
